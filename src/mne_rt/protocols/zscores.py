"""Z-score-based feedback reward protocol for MNE-RT.

This module provides :class:`ZScoreProtocol`, a stateful protocol that
normalises incoming NF values against a running baseline mean and standard
deviation and returns a reward proportional to the resulting z-score.

Classes
-------
ZScoreProtocol
    Rolling z-score normaliser with configurable direction and warmup.

class ZScoreProtocol:
    """Z-score feedback protocol with rolling baseline normalisation.

    Normalises each incoming NF value against the running mean and standard
    deviation accumulated since initialisation (or the last :meth:`reset`).
    A reward is issued when the z-score magnitude exceeds
    ``zscore_threshold`` in the requested ``direction``.

    During the first ``warmup_windows`` calls to :meth:`evaluate` the
    baseline statistics are accumulating; ``crossed`` is always ``False``
    and ``magnitude`` is always ``0.0`` until warmup completes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    direction : {"up", "down"}
        "up"  -> reward when z-score >  ``zscore_threshold``.
        "down" -> reward when z-score < -``zscore_threshold``.
    warmup_windows : int
        Number of initial evaluations used solely to seed the baseline
        statistics before any reward can be issued. Default is 20.
    smoothing : float
        EMA smoothing coefficient applied to the raw input before
        z-scoring.  Must be in ``[0, 1)``.  ``0.0`` disables smoothing.
        Applied as: ``smoothed = (1 - smoothing) * new + smoothing * prev``.
        Default is 0.0.
    min_std : float | None
        Absolute floor applied to the running standard deviation, in the raw
        units of the feature. Default is ``None``, which needs no floor: a
        standard deviation carrying no information yields a z-score of ``0.0``
        rather than being divided by an arbitrary constant.

        Pass a float only if you deliberately want an absolute floor **and**
        know your feature's magnitude. A floor above the feature's real spread
        replaces it — ``1e-6`` against band power of ~1e-14 is what made
        z-scores come out eight orders of magnitude too small before 1.2.0.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.2.0
            Default changed from ``1e-6`` to ``None``. An explicit float keeps
            its previous meaning exactly.
    zscore_threshold : float
        Minimum absolute z-score required to issue a reward. Default is 0.5.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any parameter is outside its valid range.

    Notes
    -----
    The running mean and variance are updated with Welford's online algorithm,
    which is numerically stable and requires O(1) memory per update.

    Examples
    --------
    Reward upward alpha-power deviations beyond half a standard deviation::

        proto = ZScoreProtocol(direction="up", zscore_threshold=0.5)
        for value in nf_stream:
            crossed, magnitude = proto.evaluate(value)
            if crossed:
                send_reward(magnitude)
