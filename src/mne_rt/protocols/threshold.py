class ThresholdProtocol:
    """Threshold-based NF reward protocol with optional adaptive threshold.

    Converts a continuous NF feature value into a binary reward signal.
    Optionally adapts the threshold over time to maintain a target success rate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : float
        Initial decision threshold.  Default is 0.0.
    direction : {"up", "down"}
        "up"  -> reward when value > threshold (e.g., enhance alpha).
        "down" -> reward when value < threshold (e.g., suppress beta).
        Default is "up".
    adaptive : bool
        If True, slowly adjust threshold to keep hit_rate near target_hit_rate.
        Uses an exponential moving average of recent successes.  Default is
        False.
    adapt_rate : float
        Step size for threshold adaptation (in units of the NF signal's
        running standard deviation). Larger = faster adaptation.  Default is
        0.05.
    target_hit_rate : float
        Desired proportion of windows where the threshold is crossed.
        The adaptive mechanism pushes threshold toward this rate.  Default is
        0.70.
    smoothing : float
        EMA smoothing factor for the input value before thresholding.
        0.0 = no smoothing; 0.1 = light smoothing; 0.5 = heavy smoothing.
        Applied as: smoothed = (1 - smoothing) * new + smoothing * prev.
        Default is 0.0.
    history_len : int
        Number of recent evaluations used to estimate the running hit rate
        and running standard deviation (for adaptive scaling).  Default is
        50.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any parameter is outside its valid range.

    Examples
    --------
    Basic usage — reward when alpha power exceeds a fixed threshold::

        proto = ThresholdProtocol(threshold=0.5, direction="up")
        crossed, magnitude = proto.evaluate(0.8)

    Adaptive threshold that targets a 70 % success rate::

        proto = ThresholdProtocol(
            threshold=0.0,
            direction="up",
            adaptive=True,
            target_hit_rate=0.70,
        )

        Notes
        -----
        EMA smoothing (if enabled) is applied first, then the smoothed value
        is compared against the current threshold.  The hit/miss result is
        recorded in history, and (if ``adaptive`` is True) the threshold is
        updated before the return value is assembled.

        ``magnitude`` is 0.0 when the threshold was not crossed; a positive
        float proportional to the distance from the threshold (normalised by
        the running standard deviation) when crossed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        value : float
            Current NF feature value.

        Returns
        -------
        crossed : bool
            True if the threshold was crossed in the target direction.
        magnitude : float
            Non-negative reward magnitude. 0 when not crossed;
            ``abs(smoothed - threshold) / (running_std + eps)`` when crossed.
