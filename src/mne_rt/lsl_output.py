"""LSL stream outlet for broadcasting real-time feature values.

:class:`LSLSender` creates a Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) outlet that pushes
computed feature values as a float-channel stream.  Any LSL-aware application
(Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, OpenViBE, BCI2000, another MNE-RT instance, …) can
subscribe to this stream and use the values for stimulus control or
further analysis.

This is faster and more reliable than OSC for same-machine communication
because it uses shared memory / localhost TCP rather than UDP, and LSL
handles timestamping, buffering, and clock synchronisation automatically.

Use :class:`~mne_rt.osc.OSCSender` instead when the feedback application runs
on a *different machine* and supports OSC but not LSL.

Classes
-------
LSLSender
    Thread-safe LSL outlet that pushes NF values to downstream subscribers.

Examples
--------
Send alpha power into an LSL stream named ``"ANT_NF"``::

    sender = LSLSender(stream_name="ANT_NF", n_channels=1)
    sender.push(["sensor_power"], [0.42])
    sender.close()

Pass to :meth:`~mne_rt.RTStream.record_main` alongside (or instead of) OSC::

    nf.record_main(duration=300, modality="sensor_power",
                   lsl_sender=LSLSender())

class LSLSender:
    """Thread-safe LSL outlet that broadcasts NF feature values.

    Creates a single-source LSL stream with ``n_channels`` float32 channels
    (one per active NF modality).  Channel labels are published in the stream
    description, so subscribers can select a value by name rather than by
    position -- taken from ``channel_names`` if given, otherwise from the
    modality names on the first :meth:`push` call.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stream_name : str, default "ANT_NF"
        LSL stream name visible to subscribers.
    stream_type : str, default "NF"
        LSL content type (arbitrary string; "NF" is ANT convention).
    n_channels : int, default 8
        Maximum number of channels in the outlet.  If fewer modalities are
        active, unused channels are filled with ``0.0``.  You can leave
        this at the default and the outlet will resize automatically on
        first push if needed.
    srate : float, default 0.0
        Nominal sample rate in Hz.  ``0.0`` marks the stream as irregular
        (i.e. one sample per NF window, not a fixed rate).
    source_id : str, default "ant_nf_outlet"
        Unique source identifier embedded in the stream info.
    channel_names : sequence of str | None, default None
        Channel labels to publish in the stream description.  When omitted,
        they are taken from the modality names on the first :meth:`push`,
        which rebuilds the outlet once and so briefly drops any subscriber
        that had already resolved the stream.  Pass them here when they are
        known in advance to avoid that.

    Raises
    ------
    ImportError
        If neither ``mne_lsl`` nor ``pylsl`` is installed.

    Examples
    --------
    Basic usage::

        sender = LSLSender(stream_name="ANT_NF")
        sender.push(["sensor_power", "erd_ers"], [0.42, -1.2])
        sender.close()

    Context-manager usage::

        with LSLSender() as sender:
            for value in nf_stream:
                sender.push(["sensor_power"], [value])
